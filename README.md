# Huang_Narayanswamy_Smith_CSCI2270_FinalProject

SUMMARY:
This project implements an online store. The online store will use a hash table so that stores can easily catagorize their items and add/remove items that have a structure of name, catalog, and price. Users wishing to purchase from the store can search for an item or catalog, print out the availabilities, and then they will add items to their shopping cart which will be in the form of a vector or linked list. Once user checks his/he shopping cart out, the vector/linked list will be summed up and the total price will be deducted from their funds.

HOW TO RUN:
Open up the main.cpp file using the Catalog.h and Catalog.cpp files and items.txt file 
follow the instructions on screen to buy or sell on the online catalog! The three files may have to be copied and pasted into a project. Without putting the three files (main.cpp, Catalog.cpp, Catalog.h) these is potential for the files to not link properly.

If you wish to import your own items.txt file, then the items must be listed in the order of "Category,Item Name,Price". The only categories allowed for our program are:
Sports
Men's Clothing
Women's Clothing
Electronics
Food
Movies
Games
Books
Arts and Crafts
Health and Beauty

Once the program has started running, the user has to option to enter either a buyer or a seller menu. These two menus give the users different options. There are a variety of print options, that allow to print out the catalog or the shopping cart. There are also add/remove from shopping cart and checkout options for the buyer, and add and remove items from the catalog for the buyer. 
Have fun!
