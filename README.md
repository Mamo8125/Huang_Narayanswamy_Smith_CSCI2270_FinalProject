# Huang_Narayanswamy_Smith_CSCI2270_FinalProject

SUMMARY:
This project implements an online store. The online store will use a hash table so that stores can easily catagorize their items and add/remove items that have a structure of name, catalog, and price. Users wishing to purchase from the store can search for an item or catalog, print out the availabilities, and then they will add items to their shopping cart which will be in the form of a vector or linked list. Once user checks his/he shopping cart out, the vector/linked list will be summed up and the total price will be deducted from their funds.

HOW TO RUN:
Open up the main.cpp file using the Catalog.h and Catalog.cpp files and items.txt file 
follow the instructions on screen to buy or sell on the online catalog!

DEPENDENCIES:
Code::Blocks is sufficient, nothing else needed

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
No system requirements besides a cpp code compiler, designed for terminal use
